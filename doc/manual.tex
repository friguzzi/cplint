\section{Introduction}


\texttt{cplint} is a suite of programs for reasoning with LPADs/CP-logic programs  \cite{VenVer03-TR}, \cite{VenVer04-ICLP04-IC},
\cite{VenDenBru-JELIA06},
\cite{DBLP:journals/tplp/VennekensDB09}. It contains modules for both inference and learning.

\section{Installation}
\texttt{cplint} is distributed as a pack of SWI-Prolog. To install it, use
\begin{verbatim}
?- pack_install(cplint).
\end{verbatim}
Moreover, in order to make sure you have a foreign library that matches your architecture, run
\begin{verbatim}
?- pack_rebuild(cplint). 
\end{verbatim}


\input{syntax}
\input{inference}


Then you can simply load \texttt{coin.pl} as
\begin{verbatim}
?- [coin].
\end{verbatim}
and query it with
\begin{verbatim}
?- prob(heads(coin),P).
\end{verbatim}
Note that supplying \texttt{coin.pl} as an argument to the \texttt{swipl} command currently returns errors due to bad interaction between \texttt{pita.pl} and the top-level.
The program is loaded correctly anyway but it is recommended to load it from the top-level to avoid these errors.

\subsection{Parameters}
The module makes use of a number of parameters in order to control its behavior. They can be set with the directive
\begin{verbatim}
:- set_pita(<parameter>,<value>).
\end{verbatim}
inside the couple \texttt{:-cplint.} and \texttt{:-end\_cplint.} 

The current value can be read with
\begin{verbatim}
?- setting_pita(<parameter>,Value).
\end{verbatim}
from the top-level.
The available parameters are:
\begin{itemize}
\item 
	 \verb|epsilon_parsing|: if (1 - the sum of the probabilities of all the head atoms) is larger than 
    \verb|epsilon_parsing|,
		then \texttt{pita} adds the null event to the head. Default value \texttt{0.00001}.
\item \verb|single_var|: determines how non ground clauses are treated: if \texttt{true}, a single random variable is assigned to the whole non ground clause, 
if \texttt{false}, a different random variable is assigned to every grounding of the clause. Default value \texttt{false}.
\item \verb|depth_bound|: if \texttt{true}, the depth of the derivation of the goal is limited to the value of the \texttt{depth} parameter.  Default value \texttt{false}.
\item  \texttt{depth}: maximum depth of derivations when  \verb|depth_bound| is set to \texttt{true}. Default value \texttt{2}.
\end{itemize}

\input{learning}

\subsection{Commands}
\subsubsection{Parameter Learning}
To execute EMBLEM, prepare an input file as indicated above 
(for example \verb|bongard.pl|), load it into SWI-Prolog
\begin{verbatim}
?- [bongard].
\end{verbatim}
and call
\begin{verbatim}
?- induce_par([train],P).
\end{verbatim}
to obtain in \verb|P| the program in input with the updated parameters.

The results can also be tested on a test set with
\begin{verbatim}
?- induce_par([train],[test],P,LL,AUCROC,ROC,AUCPR,PR).
\end{verbatim}
This returns the log likelihood of the test examples in \verb|LL|, the Area Under the ROC curve in \verb|AUCROC|, a dictionary containing the list of points (in the form of Prolog pairs \verb|x-y|) of the ROC curve in \verb|ROC|,
the Area Under the PR curve in \verb|AUCPR|, a dictionary containing the list of points of the PR curve in \verb|PR|.

\input{par_lear_general}

\subsubsection{Structure Learning}
To execute SLIPCOVER,
prepare an input file as indicated above 
(for example \verb|bongard.pl|), load it into SWI-Prolog
\begin{verbatim}
?- [bongard].
\end{verbatim}
and call
\begin{verbatim}
?- induce([train],P).
\end{verbatim}
to obtain in \verb|P| the learned program.

The results can also be tested on a test set with
\begin{verbatim}
?- induce([train],[test],P,LL,AUCROC,ROC,AUCPR,PR).
\end{verbatim}
returning the log likelihood of the test examples in \verb|LL|, the Area Under the ROC curve in \verb|AUCROC|, a dictionary containing the list of points (in the form of Prolog pairs \verb|x-y|) of the ROC curve in \verb|ROC|,
the Area Under the PR curve in \verb|AUCPR|, a dictionary containing the list of points of the PR curve in \verb|PR|.
