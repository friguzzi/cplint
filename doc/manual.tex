\section{Introduction}


\texttt{cplint} is a suite of programs for reasoning with LPADs/CP-logic programs  \cite{VenVer03-TR}, \cite{VenVer04-ICLP04-IC},
\cite{VenDenBru-JELIA06},
\cite{DBLP:journals/tplp/VennekensDB09}. It contains modules for both inference and learning.

\section{Installation}
\texttt{cplint} is distributed as a pack of SWI-Prolog. To install it, use
\begin{verbatim}
?- pack_install(cplint).
\end{verbatim}
Moreover, in order to make sure you have a foreign library that matches your architecture, run
\begin{verbatim}
?- pack_rebuild(cplint). 
\end{verbatim}


\input{syntax}
\input{inference}


Then you can simply load \texttt{coin.pl} as
\begin{verbatim}
?- [coin].
\end{verbatim}
and query it with
\begin{verbatim}
?- prob(heads(coin),P).
\end{verbatim}
Note that supplying \texttt{coin.pl} as an argument to the \texttt{swipl} command currently returns errors due to bad interaction between \texttt{pita.pl} and the top-level.
The program is loaded correctly anyway but it is recommended to load it from the top-level to avoid these errors.

\input{learning}

\subsection{Commands}
\subsubsection{Parameter Learning}
To execute EMBLEM, prepare an input file as indicated above,
 load it into SWI-Prolog and execute
\begin{verbatim}
?- induce_par(<list of folds>,P).
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|<list of folds>| is a list of the folds for training and
\verb|P| will contain the input program with updated parameters.

For example \verb|bongard.pl|, you can load it into SWI-Prolog
with
\begin{verbatim}
?- [bongard].
\end{verbatim}
and perform parameter learning on the \verb|train| fold with 
\begin{verbatim}
?- induce_par([train],P).
\end{verbatim}
A program can also be tested on a test set with
\begin{verbatim}
?- test(<program>,<list of folds>,LL,AUCROC,ROC,AUCPR,PR).
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|<program>| is a list of terms representing clauses and
\verb|<list of folds>| is a list of folds.
This returns the log likelihood of the test examples in \verb|LL|, the Area Under the ROC curve in \verb|AUCROC|, a dictionary containing the list of points (in the form of Prolog pairs \verb|x-y|) of the ROC curve in \verb|ROC|,
the Area Under the PR curve in \verb|AUCPR|, a dictionary containing the list of points of the PR curve in \verb|PR|.

For example, to test on fold \verb|test| the program learned on fold \verb|train| you can run the query
\begin{verbatim}
?- induce_par([train],P),
   test(P,[test],LL,AUCROC,ROC,AUCPR,PR).
\end{verbatim}
Or you can test the input program on the fold \verb|test| with
\begin{verbatim}
?- in(P),
test(P,[test],LL,AUCROC,ROC,AUCPR,PR).
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Structure Learning}
To execute SLIPCOVER,
prepare an input file as indicated above, load it into SWI-Prolog
and call
\begin{verbatim}
?- induce(<list of folds>,P).
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|<list of folds>| is a list of the folds for training and
\verb|P| will contain the learned program.

For example \verb|bongard.pl|, you can load it into SWI-Prolog
with
\begin{verbatim}
?- [bongard].
\end{verbatim}
and perform structure learning on the \verb|train| fold with 
\begin{verbatim}
?- induce([train],P).
\end{verbatim}
A program can also be tested on a test set with \verb|test/7| as
described above.
