\input{inference}

\verb|cplint| on SWISH allows two types of programs: LPAD and Prolog. In the first, you create a new LPAD in the editor, in the latter a Prolog program. 

In LPADs, you write in the editor the program without the library import and the \verb|:- cplint| and \verb|:- end_cplint.| compiler directives.

You ask queries by writing the atom of which you want to compute the probability. In the coin example, the probability of \verb|heads(coin)| can be obtained with the 
\begin{verbatim}
?- heads(coin).
\end{verbatim}

In Prolog programs, you have to enter the program above (\verb|coin.pl|) and ask the probability of an atom using the predicate \verb|prob/2| as in
\begin{verbatim}
?- prob(heads(coin),P).
\end{verbatim}
You can also see the probability of the query being true and 
being false as a bar chart with
\begin{verbatim}
?- prob_bar(heads(coin),P).
\end{verbatim}
if you include
\begin{verbatim}
:- use_rendering(c3).
\end{verbatim}
before \verb|:- cplint.|

\subsection{Commands}
\subsubsection{Parameter Learning}
To execute EMBLEM, prepare an input file in the editor panel as indicated above 
(see example \verb|bongard.pl|) 
and call
\begin{verbatim}
?- induce_par([train],P).
\end{verbatim}
to obtain in \verb|P| the program in input with the updated parameters.

The results can also be tested on a test set with
\begin{verbatim}
?- induce_par([train],[test],P,LL,AUCROC,ROC,AUCPR,PR).
\end{verbatim}
This returns the log likelihood of the test examples in \verb|LL|, the Area Under the ROC curve in \verb|AUCROC|, a dictionary containing the list of points (in the form of Prolog pairs \verb|x-y|) of the ROC curve in \verb|ROC|,
the Area Under the PR curve in \verb|AUCPR|, a dictionary containing the list of points of the PR curve in \verb|PR|.

By including
\begin{verbatim}
:- use_rendering(c3).
:- use_rendering(lpad).
\end{verbatim}
in the code before \verb|:- sc.| the curves will be shown as graphs and the output program will be pretty printed.

\subsubsection{Structure Learning}
To execute SLIPCOVER,
prepare an input file in the editor panel as indicated above 
(for example \verb|bongard.pl|)
and call
\begin{verbatim}
?- induce([train],P).
\end{verbatim}
to obtain in \verb|P| the learned program.

The results can also be tested on a test set with
\begin{verbatim}
?- induce([train],[test],P,LL,AUCROC,ROC,AUCPR,PR).
\end{verbatim}
returning the log likelihood of the test examples in \verb|LL|, the Area Under the ROC curve in \verb|AUCROC|, a dictionary containing the list of points (in the form of Prolog pairs \verb|x-y|) of the ROC curve in \verb|ROC|,
the Area Under the PR curve in \verb|AUCPR|, a dictionary containing the list of points of the PR curve in \verb|PR|.

By including
\begin{verbatim}
:- use_rendering(c3).
:- use_rendering(lpad).
\end{verbatim}
in the code before \verb|:- sc.| the curves will be shown as graphs and the output program will be pretty printed.
