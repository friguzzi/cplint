abstract="We introduce a probabilistic language and an efficient inference algorithm based on distributional clauses for static and dynamic inference in hybrid relational domains. Static inference is based on sampling, where the samples represent (partial) worlds (with discrete and continuous variables). Furthermore, we use backward reasoning to determine which facts should be included in the partial worlds. For filtering in dynamic models we combine the static inference algorithm with particle filters and guarantee that the previous partial samples can be safely forgotten, a condition that does not hold in most logical filtering frameworks. Experiments show that the proposed framework can outperform classic sampling methods for static and dynamic inference and that it is promising for robotics and vision applications. In addition, it provides the correct results in domains in which most probabilistic programming languages fail.",

In this paper we concentrate on the problem of approximate inference in probabilistic logic programming languages based on the distribution semantics.
A successful approximate approach is based on Monte Carlo sampling, that consists in verifying the truth of the query in a normal program sampled from the probabilistic program.
The ProbLog system includes such an algorithm and so does the cplint suite.
In this paper we propose an approach for Monte Carlo inference that is based on a program transformation that translates a probabilistic program into a normal program to which the query can be posed.  The current sample is stored in the internal database of the Yap Prolog engine.
The resulting system, called MCINTYRE for Monte Carlo INference wiTh Yap REcord, is evaluated on various problems: biological networks, artificial datasets and a hidden Markov model.  MCINTYRE is compared with the Monte Carlo algorithms of ProbLog and  and with the  exact inference  of the PITA system. The results show  that MCINTYRE is faster than the other Monte Carlo systems.},

abstract={In this  paper we  propose to apply  the Information  Bottleneck (IB) approach  to the  sub-class of
Statistical Relational  Learning (SRL) languages that  are reducible to Bayesian  networks. When the
resulting networks involve hidden variables, learning these languages requires the use of techniques
for  learning from incomplete  data such  as the  Expectation Maximization  (EM) algorithm.
Recently, the IB approach was shown to be able to avoid some of the local maxima in which EM can get
trapped when learning with hidden variables.  Here  we present the algorithm Relational Information Bottleneck
(RIB)
that learns the parameters of SRL languages reducible
to Bayesian Networks.  
 In particular, we present the specialization  of RIB to a  language belonging to the family of languages based on the distribution semantics, Logic Programs with  Annotated Disjunction (LPADs). This language is prototypical for such a family and its equivalent Bayesian networks contain hidden  variables. RIB is evaluated on the IMDB, Cora and artificial datasets and compared with LeProbLog, EM, Alchemy and PRISM. 
The  experimental results show that  RIB has good performances especially when some logical atoms are unobserved. 
Moreover, it is particularly suitable when learning from interpretations that share the same Herbrand base.},

abstract={Logic Programs with Annotated Disjunctions and CP-logic are two different but related languages for expressing probabilistic information in logic programming.
The paper presents a top down interpreter for computing the probability of a query from a program in one of these two languages when the program is acyclic. 
The algorithm is based on the one available for ProbLog.
The performances of the algorithm are compared with those of a Bayesian reasoner and with those of the ProbLog interpreter. On programs that have a small grounding, the Bayesian reasoner is more scalable, but programs with a large grounding require the top down interpreter. The comparison with ProbLog shows that, even if the added expressiveness effectively requires more computation resources, the top down interpreter can still solve 
problem of significant size.

  abstract = {The Independent Choice Logic (ICL) is a  language for expressing 
probabilistic information in logic programming that adopts a distribution 
semantics: an ICL theory defines a distribution over a set of possible worlds 
that are normal logic programs. The probability of a query is then given by the 
sum of the probabilities of worlds where the query is true.

The ICL semantics requires the theories to be acyclic. This is a strong 
limitation that rules out many interesting programs.
In this paper we present an extension of the ICL semantics that allows theories 
to be modularly acyclic.

Inference with ICL can be performed with the Cilog2 system that  computes 
explanations to queries and then  makes them mutually incompatible by means of 
an iterative algorithm.

We propose the system PICL (for Probabilistic inference with ICL) that computes 
the explanations to queries by means of a modification of SLDNF\--resolution 
and then makes them mutually incompatible by means of Binary Decision Diagrams.

PICL and Cilog2 are compared on problems that involve computing the probability 
of a connection between two nodes in biological graphs and social networks. 
PICL turned to be more efficient, handling larger networks/more complex queries 
in a shorter time than Cilog2. This is true both for marginal and for 
conditional queries.

Disjunctions}},
journal={Journal of Algorithms in Logic, Informatics and Cognition },
publisher={Elsevier},
note={,\ in press},
year=2009,
abstract={Logic Programs with Annotated Disjunctions (LPADs) allow to express 
probabilistic information in logic programming. The semantics of an LPAD is 
given in terms of well\--founded models of the normal logic programs obtained 
by selecting one disjunct from each ground LPAD clause. 

Inference on LPADs can be performed using either the system Ailog2, that was 
developed for the Independent Choice Logic, or SLDNFAD, an algorithm based on 
SLDNF.  However, both of these algorithms run the risk of going into infinite 
loops and of performing redundant computations.

In order to avoid these problems, we present SLGAD resolution that  computes 
the (conditional) probability of a ground query from a range\--restricted LPAD 
and is  based on  SLG resolution for normal logic programs. As SLG, it uses 
tabling to avoid some infinite loops and to avoid redundant computations.

The performances of SLGAD are evaluated on classical benchmarks for normal logic 
programs under the well\--founded semantics, namely a 2\--person game and the 
ancestor relation, and on a game of dice.

SLGAD is compared with  Ailog2 and  SLDNFAD on the problems in which they do 
not go into infinite loops, namely those that are described by a  modularly 
acyclic program.

On the 2\--person game and the ancestor relation, SLGAD is more expensive than 
SLDNFAD on problems where SLDNFAD succeeds but is faster than Ailog2 when the 
query is true in an exponential number of instances.

If the program requires the repeated computation of similar goals, as for the 
dice game, then SLGAD outperforms both Ailog2 and SLDNFAD.},

  abstract = {Logic Programs with Annotated Disjunctions and CP-logic are two different
	but related languages for expressing probabilistic information in
	logic programming. The paper presents a top down interpreter for
	computing the probability of a query from a program in one of these
	two languages. The algorithm is based on the one available for ProbLog.
	The performances of the algorithm are compared with those of a Bayesian
	reasoner and with those of the ProbLog interpreter. On programs that
	have a small grounding, the Bayesian reasoner is more scalable, but
	programs with a large grounding require the top down interpreter.
	The comparison with ProbLog shows that the added expressiveness effectively
	requires more computation resources.},
