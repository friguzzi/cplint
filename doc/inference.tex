\section{Inference}
\label{inf}
\texttt{cplint} answers queries using the module \verb|pita| or \verb|mcintyre|. The first performs the program transformation technique of \cite{RigSwi10-ICLP10-IC}. Differently from that work, techniques alternative to tabling and answer subsumption are used. The latter performs approximate inference by sampling
using a different program transformation technique and is described in \cite{Rig13-FI-IJ}. Only \verb|mcintyre| is able to handle continuous
random variables.

For answering queries, you have to prepare a Prolog file where you first load the inference module (for example \verb|pita|), initialize it with a directive (for example \verb|:- pita|) and then enclose the LPAD
clauses in \verb|:-begin_lpad.| and \verb|:-end_lpad.| For example, the coin program above can be stored in \href{http://cplint.lamping.unife.it/example/inference/coin.pl}{\texttt{coin.pl}} for performing inference
with \verb|pita| as follows
\begin{verbatim}
:- use_module(library(pita)).
:- pita.
:- begin_lpad.
heads(Coin):1/2 ; tails(Coin):1/2:- 
toss(Coin),\+biased(Coin).

heads(Coin):0.6 ; tails(Coin):0.4:- 
toss(Coin),biased(Coin).

fair(Coin):0.9 ; biased(Coin):0.1.

toss(coin).
:- end_lpad.
\end{verbatim}
The same program for \verb|mcintyre| is
\begin{verbatim}
:- use_module(library(mcintyre)).
:- mc.
:- begin_lpad.
heads(Coin):1/2 ; tails(Coin):1/2:- 
toss(Coin),\+biased(Coin).

heads(Coin):0.6 ; tails(Coin):0.4:- 
toss(Coin),biased(Coin).

fair(Coin):0.9 ; biased(Coin):0.1.

toss(coin).
:- end_lpad.
\end{verbatim}
You can have also (non-probabilistic) clauses outside \verb|:-begin/end_lpad.| These are considered as database clauses.
In \verb|pita| subgoals in the body of probabilistic clauses can query them by enclosing the query in \verb|db/1|.
For example (\href{http://cplint.lamping.unife.it/example/inference/testdb.pl}{\texttt{testdb.pl}})
\begin{verbatim}
:- use_module(library(pita)).
:- pita.
:- begin_lpad.
sampled_male(X):0.5:-
  db(male(X)).
:- end_lpad.
male(john).
male(david).
\end{verbatim}
You can also use \verb|findall/3| on subgoals defined by database clauses
(\href{http://cplint.lamping.unife.it/example/inference/persons.pl}{\texttt{persons.pl}})
\begin{verbatim}
:- use_module(library(pita)).
:- pita.
:- begin_lpad.
male:M/P; female:F/P:-
  findall(Male,male(Male),LM),
  findall(Female,female(Female),LF),
  length(LM,M),
  length(LF,F),
  P is F+M.
:- end_lpad.
male(john).
male(david).
female(anna).
female(elen).
female(cathy).
\end{verbatim}
Aggregate predicates on probabilistic subgoals are not implemented due to their high
computational cost (if the aggregation is over $n$ atoms, the values of the
aggregation are potentially $2^n$). The Yap version of \verb|cplint| includes
reasoning algorithms that allows aggregate predicates on probabilistic subgoals,
see \url{http://ds.ing.unife.it/~friguzzi/software/cplint/manual.html}.

In \verb|mcintyre| you can query database clauses in the body of probabilistic clauses without any special syntax. You can also 
use \verb|findall/3|.
