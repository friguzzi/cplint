The documentation is written in rst format.
To build the documentation make sure you have sphinx installed it with:
    
    > sudo apt-get install python3-sphinx

and also

    > sudo apt install python3-sphinxcontrib.bibtex    


To build the documentation using sphinx, move to doc, make sure the file index.rst is there and type:

    > make html

The result html file will be in _build/html/index.html

To build the pdf, make sure you have installed

    texlive-latex-recommended
    texlive-fonts-recommended
    texlive-latex-extra
    latexmk (this is a Sphinx requirement on GNU/Linux and MacOS X for functioning of make latexpdf)
    
to install type

    > sudo apt install latexmk
    > sudo apt install texlive-latex-recommended texlive-latex-extra texlive-fonts-recommended 
    
in the same folder as before type:

    > make latexpdf LATEXMKOPTS="-silent"

To generate the pdf

    > make latexpdf
    
or

    > make latexpdf LATEXMKOPTS="-silent"

to have less output.

Note that you maybe need to run the command two times in order to link also the bibliography which is 
located in newbib.bib

The result pdf file will be in _build/latex/cplint.pdf. This because the program compiles the .rst file
in a .tex file and then calls latexmk to compile the .tex file.

The file conf.py in this folder defines some parameters for the compilation. In particular
the number of the release and the authors.
