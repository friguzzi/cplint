\section{Introduction}


\texttt{cplint} is a suite of programs for reasoning with LPADs/CP-logic programs  \cite{VenVer03-TR}, \cite{VenVer04-ICLP04-IC},
\cite{VenDenBru-JELIA06},
\cite{DBLP:journals/tplp/VennekensDB09}. It contains modules for both inference and learning.

\texttt{cplint} is available in two versions, one for Yap Prolog and one for SWI-Prolog. They differ slightly in the features offered.
This manual is about the SWI-Prolog version. You can find the manual for the Yap version at \url{http://ds.ing.unife.it/~friguzzi/software/cplint/manual.html}.

\section{Installation}
\texttt{cplint} is distributed as a \href{http://www.swi-prolog.org/pack/list?p=cplint}{pack} of \href{http://www.swi-prolog.org/}{SWI-Prolog}. To install it, use
\begin{verbatim}
?- pack_install(cplint).
\end{verbatim}
Moreover, in order to make sure you have a foreign library that matches your architecture, run
\begin{verbatim}
?- pack_rebuild(cplint). 
\end{verbatim}


\input{syntax}
\input{semantics}
\input{inference}


To run a query, you can simply load the Prolog file, for example \href{http://cplint.eu/e/coin.pl}{\texttt{coin.pl}}, as
\begin{verbatim}
?- [coin].
\end{verbatim}
Note that supplying \href{http://cplint.eu/e/coin.pl}{\texttt{coin.pl}} as an argument to the \verb|swipl| command currently returns errors due to bad interaction between \verb|pita| and the top-level.
The program is loaded correctly anyway but it is recommended to load it from the top-level to avoid these errors.
