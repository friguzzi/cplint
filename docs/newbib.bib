  abstract="We introduce a probabilistic language and an efficient inference algorithm based on distributional clauses for static and dynamic inference in hybrid relational domains. Static inference is based on sampling, where the samples represent (partial) worlds (with discrete and continuous variables). Furthermore, we use backward reasoning to determine which facts should be included in the partial worlds. For filtering in dynamic models we combine the static inference algorithm with particle filters and guarantee that the previous partial samples can be safely forgotten, a condition that does not hold in most logical filtering frameworks. Experiments show that the proposed framework can outperform classic sampling methods for static and dynamic inference and that it is promising for robotics and vision applications. In addition, it provides the correct results in domains in which most probabilistic programming languages fail.",

  journal = {Fundamenta Informaticae},
  abstract = {Probabilistic Logic Programming is receiving an increasing attention for its ability to model domains with complex and uncertain relations among entities. 
In this paper we concentrate on the problem of approximate inference in probabilistic logic programming languages based on the distribution semantics.
A successful approximate approach is based on Monte Carlo sampling, that consists in verifying the truth of the query in a normal program sampled from the probabilistic program.
The ProbLog system includes such an algorithm and so does the cplint suite.
In this paper we propose an approach for Monte Carlo inference that is based on a program transformation that translates a probabilistic program into a normal program to which the query can be posed.  The current sample is stored in the internal database of the Yap Prolog engine.
The resulting system, called MCINTYRE for Monte Carlo INference wiTh Yap REcord, is evaluated on various problems: biological networks, artificial datasets and a hidden Markov model.  MCINTYRE is compared with the Monte Carlo algorithms of ProbLog and  and with the  exact inference  of the PITA system. The results show  that MCINTYRE is faster than the other Monte Carlo systems.},

  abstract = {Recently much work in Machine Learning has concentrated on using expressive representation languages that combine aspects of logic and probability. A whole field has emerged, called Statistical Relational Learning, rich of successful applications in a variety of domains.
In this paper we present a Machine Learning technique targeted to Probabilistic Logic Programs, a family of formalisms where uncertainty is represented using Logic Programming tools.
Among various proposals for Probabilistic Logic Programming, the one based on the distribution semantics is gaining popularity and is the basis for languages such as ICL, PRISM, ProbLog and Logic Programs with Annotated Disjunctions.
This paper proposes a technique for learning parameters of these languages. Since their equivalent Bayesian networks contain hidden variables, an Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is adopted.
In order to speed the computation up, expectations are computed directly on the Binary Decision Diagrams that are built for inference.
The resulting system, called EMBLEM for ``EM over Bdds for probabilistic Logic programs Efficient Mining'', has been applied to a number of datasets and showed good performances both in terms of speed and memory usage. In particular its speed allows the execution of a high number of restarts, resulting in good  quality of the solutions.},

parameters of such programs has been considered by various authors, the problem
of learning the structure is yet to be explored in depth. In this work we present an
approximate search method based on a one-player game approach, called LEMUR. It
sees the problem of learning the structure of a probabilistic logic program as a multiarmed bandit problem, relying on the Monte-Carlo tree search UCT algorithm that
combines the precision of tree search with the generality of random sampling. LEMUR
works by modifying the UCT algorithm in a fashion similar to FUSE, that considers a
finite unknown horizon and deals with the problem of having a huge branching factor.
The proposed system has been tested on various real-world datasets and has shown
good performance with respect to other state of the art statistical relational learning
approaches in terms of classification abilities.},
